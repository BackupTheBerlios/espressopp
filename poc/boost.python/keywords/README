PYCPP:
======

This is a proof of concept on how to call C++ objects from
Python and how to call a Python Script from C++.
It shows how keyword arguments can be handled in python and in C++.
It needs python2.5 (developer version) and boost_1_35.

INSTALLATION:
=============

Before executing "make", you have to set the locations where boost and
python can be found.

The Makefile will create a binary file ("pycpp") which can
be executed from the command line with:

    ./pycpp example.py

and it will create a python module ("pycpp.so") which can be
imported into python with

     import pycpp

within a python-script.
