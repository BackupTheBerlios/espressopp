Virtual Iterator:
=================

NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES  33000

lj_test.1

  - FullPairIterator, LennardJonesInteraction
  - compute loop is inlined in the main routine

  time: 5.898 seconds

  This test is only for comparison of data.

lj_test.2

  - FullPairIterator derived from PairIterator
  - compute loop with PairIterator, Interaction as own subroutine

  time: 14.845 seconds

  This test shows that virtual iterators should not be taken.

lj_test.4

  - Impelementation with Cached Iterator (TB)
 
lj_test.3

  - template<Interaction, PairIterator>
  - instantiated with compute<LennardJonesInteraction, FullPairIterator>
  Time: 5.43


  This is the preferred solution.

  - be careful: do not use pointer for Iterator otherwise slower
  - even local copy of the FullPairIterator helps
  Time: 6.56

  - be careful: FullPairIterator should no more derived from PairIterator

  Time: 6.56

Open:

- inlining of LennardJones interaction gives different results
  possible reason: particles too close
  workaround: generating particles on a mesh (JH)

- more realistic: periodic boundary conditions (JH)

ToDo:

- compiling template<Interaction, PairIterator> for many 
  different pairs (roughly 50 Interactinos, 15 PairIterators)
  TB

- Branching: moving the condition to the iterator or inner loop 
  JH

- Makefile for the different tests (Integrate in the build system), TB
