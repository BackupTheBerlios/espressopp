EspressoPP
----------

This is a first version of Espresso++ that has already the specified directory structure.
Furthermore, it contains the input file for autoconf + automake.

It is a 'deep' project, meaning that it has source code organised into sub-projects. 

Directory Structure:

   cpp
      kernel        - C++ code for the kernel of Espresso++

INSTALL
============

autogen.sh        - makes the right calls of autoconf + automake
                  - Main input file is configure.ac

          --with_log4cxx=/home/brandes/SOFTWARE/log4cxx

Note:   make install prefix=/home/brandes/Espresso  
        (does not work at this time, installation directory must be set for configure)
