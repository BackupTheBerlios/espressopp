EspressoPP
----------

This is a first version of Espresso++ (Hello Word) that has already the specified directory structure.
Furthermore, it contains the input file for autoconf + automake.

It is a 'deep' project, meaning that it has source code organised into sub-projects. 

Directory Structure:
=====================

src
   cpp
      kernel        - C++ code for the kernel of Espresso++
         test       - Unit test code

Note: Each directory contains the input file Makefile.am for automake

INSTALL
=======

Installation in four steps:

1. Generate configure script 

autogen.sh        - makes the right calls of autoconf + automake
                  - Main input file is configure.ac

2. Configure the system

configure --with_boost=/home/brandes/boost
          --prefix=$HOME/EspressoPP

3. Make

make        ! genrates (executables + ) libraries

make check    ! generate and run test cases

4. Installation in own directory

make install

Note:   make install prefix=$HOME/EspressoPP
        (does not work at this time, installation directory must be set for configure)
